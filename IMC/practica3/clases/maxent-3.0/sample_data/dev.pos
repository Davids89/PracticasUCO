AB/LS -/: A/DT new/JJ B-cell-specific/JJ enhancer/NN element/NN has/VBZ been/VBN identified/VBN 3'/JJ of/IN E4/NN and/CC the/DT octamerlike/JJ motifs/NNS in/IN the/DT human/JJ immunoglobulin/NN heavy-chain/NN gene/NN enhancer/NN ./. 
Tandem/JJ copies/NNS of/IN this/DT 67-bp/JJ MnlI-AluI/NN fragment/NN ,/, when/WRB fused/VBN to/TO the/DT chloramphenicol/JJ acetyltransferase/NN gene/NN driven/VBN by/IN the/DT conalbumin/JJ promoter/NN ,/, stimulated/VBD transcription/NN in/IN B/NN cells/NNS but/CC not/RB in/IN Jurkat/NN T/NN cells/NNS or/CC HeLa/NN cells/NNS ./. 
Footprinting/NN analysis/NN revealed/VBD that/IN the/DT identical/JJ sequence/NN CCGAAACTGAAAAGG/NN ,/, designated/VBN E6/NN ,/, was/VBD protected/VBN by/IN nuclear/JJ extracts/NNS from/IN B/NN cells/NNS ,/, T/NN cells/NNS ,/, or/CC HeLa/NN cells/NNS ./. 
Gel/NN mobility/NN shift/NN assays/NNS using/VBG a/DT synthetic/JJ E6/NN motif/NN detected/VBD a/DT B-cell-specific/JJ complex/NN in/IN addition/NN to/TO a/DT ubiquitous/JJ band/NN found/VBN also/RB in/IN T/NN cells/NNS and/CC HeLa/NN cells/NNS ./. 
In/IN agreement/NN with/IN the/DT results/NNS of/IN gel/NN retardation/NN assays/NNS ,/, tandem/JJ copies/NNS of/IN the/DT E6/NN motif/NN stimulated/VBD transcription/NN in/IN ARH77/NN and/CC Raji/NN cells/NNS but/CC not/RB in/IN Jurkat/NN or/CC HeLa/NN cells/NNS ./. 
Furthermore/RB ,/, a/DT mutant/JJ E6/NN motif/NN lost/VBD both/CC in/FW vitro/FW binding/NN activity/NN and/CC in/FW vivo/FW enhancer/NN activity/NN ./. 
In/IN striking/JJ contrast/NN to/TO the/DT mouse/NN Ig/NN heavy-chain/JJ enhancer/NN ,/, in/IN which/WDT the/DT octamer/NN motif/NN acts/VBZ as/IN a/DT B-cell-specific/JJ enhancer/NN element/NN ,/, the/DT human/JJ enhancer/NN contains/VBZ an/DT octamerlike/JJ sequence/NN with/IN one/CD base/NN substitution/NN which/WDT bound/VBD octamer-binding/JJ proteins/NNS with/IN only/RB very/RB low/JJ affinity/NN and/CC showed/VBD no/DT enhancer/NN activity/NN of/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ ./. 
Interestingly/RB ,/, the/DT MnlI-AluI/NN fragment/NN could/MD suppress/VB the/DT basal-level/JJ activity/NN of/IN the/DT conalbumin/JJ promoter/NN in/IN both/CC Jurkat/NN and/CC HeLa/NN cells/NNS ./. 
Moreover/RB ,/, simian/JJ virus/NN 40/CD enhancer/NN activity/NN was/VBD blocked/VBN by/IN the/DT MnlI-AluI/NN fragment/NN in/IN HeLa/NN cells/NNS but/CC not/RB in/IN B/NN cells/NNS ./. 
Thus/RB ,/, the/DT novel/JJ enhancer/NN element/NN identified/VBN in/IN this/DT study/NN is/VBZ probably/RB a/DT target/NN site/NN for/IN both/CC positive/JJ and/CC negative/JJ factors/NNS ./.
